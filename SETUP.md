# Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps **in order**. Each step must be completed before the next.

---

## Step 1 — Prerequisites (one-time, per machine)

Install these tools if you don't have them:

| Tool | Install |
|---|---|
| Node.js 22+ | https://nodejs.org |
| pnpm | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| GitHub CLI | https://cli.github.com |

Then log into GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh auth login
```
Choose **GitHub.com → HTTPS → Login with browser**.

---

## Step 2 — Create your `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in **all required values**:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase → Project → Settings → Database → Connection string (Transaction mode) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Run: `openssl rand -base64 32` — paste the output |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `http://localhost:3001/api/v1` for dev. Update to your Railway/Render URL for production |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | https://resend.com → API Keys |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | https://console.cloud.google.com → APIs → Credentials |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Same as above |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | https://console.anthropic.com |

> Leave `R2_*` and `AWS_*` empty unless you are using file uploads.

---

## Step 3 — Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

## Step 4 — Set up the database

```bash
pnpm db:generate    # generate Prisma client
pnpm db:push        # push schema to Supabase (dev only)
```

---

## Step 5 — Push GitHub secrets for CI/CD

This sets `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` as secrets in your GitHub repo so CI/CD can build and test your code automatically.

```bash
pnpm setup:secrets
```

You should see:
```
✅  Setting DATABASE_URL
✅  Setting JWT_SECRET
✅  Setting NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

> **Troubleshooting:** If it says "could not detect repo", run:
> ```bash
> bash scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
> ```

---

## Step 6 — Start the development servers

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts both the web app (`localhost:3000`) and the API (`localhost:3001`).

---

## Step 7 — Verify CI is passing

Go to your GitHub repo → **Actions tab**.

You should see a green run with 3 jobs:
- ✅ Build Workspace Packages
- ✅ Web — Type Check & Build
- ✅ API — Type Check & Build

If any are red, check the error logs and compare your `.env` values.

---

## Optional — Auto-deploy to production

If you got this project by bootstrapping it through the 0bit platform, Vercel
and Railway are already connected and deploying on every push — nothing to
do here.

Setting this up yourself (e.g. you cloned this repo directly, outside the
0bit bootstrap flow): connect the repo natively in each platform's own
dashboard rather than through GitHub Actions —
[Vercel → Import Project](https://vercel.com/new) (root directory `apps/web`)
and [Railway → New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo](https://railway.app/new)
(root directory `apps/api`). Both auto-deploy on push once connected, no
extra secrets or workflow files needed.

## Summary — Quick reference

```
cp .env.example .env     → fill in values
pnpm install             → install packages
pnpm db:generate         → generate Prisma types
pnpm db:push             → sync database schema
pnpm setup:secrets       → push secrets to GitHub
pnpm dev                 → start local development
```
